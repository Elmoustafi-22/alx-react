# 0x08. React Redux reducer+selector

## Overview
This project focuses on creating and managing reducers and selectors within a React-Redux application. The goal is to enhance the application's state management by implementing reducers, using Immutable.js for immutability, and optimizing data access with selectors.

## Project Structure
1. **Basic Reducer:** 
   - Create a UI reducer to manage UI state.
   - Write tests to validate the reducer's functionality.

2. **Immutable.js in Reducers:**
   - Integrate Immutable.js into the UI reducer for state management.
   - Update tests to reflect the changes.

3. **Course Reducer:**
   - Implement a reducer to manage a list of courses.
   - Handle actions for loading, selecting, and unselecting courses.

4. **Notification Reducer:**
   - Create a reducer to manage notifications.
   - Implement actions for loading, reading, and filtering notifications.

5. **Normalization with Normalizr:**
   - Use Normalizr to normalize course and notification data.
   - Update reducers to handle normalized data and use Immutable.js for state updates.

6. **Selectors:**
   - Implement selectors to access and filter notifications.
   - Write tests to ensure selectors work as expected.
