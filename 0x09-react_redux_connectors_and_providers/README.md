# 0x09. React Redux Connectors and Providers

## Overview
This project focuses on integrating React applications with Redux to manage global state efficiently. It covers key Redux concepts such as connectors, providers, middleware, and action creators. By the end of this project, you'll learn how to connect React components to the Redux store and optimize performance using tools like Redux Thunk and Reselect.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement Redux connectors.
- Map state and actions to React components using `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`.
- Handle asynchronous actions with Redux Thunk.
- Set up and use Redux providers to manage global state.
- Optimize Redux performance with Reselect.
- Debug applications using Redux DevTools.

## Project Structure
- **App:** Contains the main application logic and connections to the Redux store.
- **Reducers:** Handle state changes based on actions.
- **Actions:** Define and dispatch actions to update the state.
- **Selectors:** Optimize state selection and improve performance.
- **Tests:** Ensure the correctness of Redux integration and functionality.
